# Text-Summarization-for-Generating-News-Headlines-using-Deep-Learning-

Summarization is a useful technique for identifying the main idea and presenting information concisely and effectively. News summarization is still an interesting problem space because it inherently uses diverse proper nouns referring to people, places, and events happening internationally and describes events. In this project, many ways to predict headlines that summarizes the main idea from the text of the news by implementing various models have been explored by using well-curated datasets and the processing that goes into data-intensive models.

We are tried a new attempt to perform News Headlines Generation using Neural networks. It is implemented by using various neural network models like LSTM, SimpleRNN, GRU and their comparisons of losses and accuracies are shown.
